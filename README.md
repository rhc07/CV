## About Me 👋🏾

A driven and aspiring Junior Software Developer, looking for a role to develop and harness my current programming expertise within an industry that I'm passionate about.

After graduating from Southamption Solent Univiersity with a Film Studies degree, I spent a few years living and working abroad before spending some time in sales and marketing roles across London.

I have recently completed a 12 week intensive bootcamp at Makers Academy where I was able to grow from an interested novice programmer into a confident Junior Developer. My experience at Makers Academy has given me the foundations of best coding practices, which I hope to bring into my next role. I can't wait to take on my first role within the tech industry in London where I can further expand my current coding skill-set.
